They have provided as a dataset of used car sales and have asked us to determine which factors make a car more or less expensive. A recent [report](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183713/value-of-us-passenger-cas-sales-and-leases-since-1990/) shows that used car sales doubles the amount of new car sales. The used car market is lucrative with high demand from consumers. Our stakeholder wants to stay ahead of the curve and understanding their customer's preferences can help lead to more sales. Used car dealerships also have to acquire cars for inventory from other entities. If our stakeholder can reasonably determine the cost of a used vehicle they can better understand their margins and when to purchase a vehicle for inventory. It is also important to understand what customers value in used cars. Knowing what drives a consumer to purchase a used vehicle can help our stakeholders avoid costly mistakes when acquiring inventory."

The amount of missing data is concerning and the best course of action may be to impute them. That may mislead our model and we should be wary of that. However, dropping over 40% of the data isn't something we should do. One way to impute this data would be to find a finding an identical year and model then we would select the most seen value for that respective column; we can leverage scipy's `SimpleImputer`.
