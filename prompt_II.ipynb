    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

They have provided as a dataset of used car sales and have asked us to determine which factors make a car more or less expensive. A recent [report](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183713/value-of-us-passenger-cas-sales-and-leases-since-1990/) shows that used car sales doubles the amount of new car sales. The used car market is lucrative with high demand from consumers. Our stakeholder wants to stay ahead of the curve and understanding their customer's preferences can help lead to more sales. Used car dealerships also have to acquire cars for inventory from other entities. If our stakeholder can reasonably determine the cost of a used vehicle they can better understand their margins and when to purchase a vehicle for inventory. It is also important to understand what customers value in used cars. Knowing what drives a consumer to purchase a used vehicle can help our stakeholders avoid costly mistakes when acquiring inventory."

Size is missing in 72% of rows. Drive is missing in 31% of rows. I know that these attributes are important in determining the price of a car from prior analysis. The amount of missing data is concerning and the best course of action may be to impute them. That may mislead our model and we should be wary of that. However, losing over 40% of the data isn't something we should do lightly. One way to impute this data would be to find a finding an identical year and model then we would select the most seen value for that respective column. This can help us deduce the missing attributes.\n",
